This is an application that lets users interact with a database which contains information about the houses that were sold on Funda combined with public available Data such as demographics, housing info, labour data, crime and tourist data.

Please note the following before checking the Code.
1. In the folder SQL you can find all SQL codes to initialize the DB and its tables. These codes were translated into 
    Python code and are, after some DB Design changes, not valid anymore. But we still included them to show that we also worked with SQL
2. All necessary codes can be found in the Python_wrapper folder
3. To run the app start the python_app.py file
4. The wrapper.py contains all querys and function we created with a little Â© info who created which piece of code
5. To run the app, everythin in the requirements.txt need to be installed on the machine
6. The workflow.md shows our Git workflow
7. Each team member has his own folder to try out stuff, but all the final codes are added to the wrappe.py file
